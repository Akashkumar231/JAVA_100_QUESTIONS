/*
        Java while loop is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a given Boolean condition.
        The while loop can be thought of as a repeating if statement. While loop in Java comes into use when we need to repeatedly execute a block of statements.
        The while loop is considered as a repeating if statement. If the number of iterations is not fixed, it is recommended to use the while loop.
